          IMPORTANT LEGAL NOTICE: PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY.
          THEY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS AND INCLUDE A BINDING
          ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND A WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION RIGHTS.
        </p>

        <p>
          Welcome to Playcer! These Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;) govern
          your access to and use of the Playcer website, mobile applications,
          and all related services (collectively, the &quot;Service&quot;). The
          Service is owned and operated by Playcer Inc. (&quot;Playcer,&quot;
          &quot;we,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; or &quot;our&quot;).
        </p>

        <p>
          By accessing or using the Service, registering for an account, or
          clicking &quot;I Agree,&quot; you are entering into a legally binding
          agreement with us and agree to be bound by these Terms and our
          Privacy Policy, which is incorporated herein by reference.
        </p>

        <p>
          IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE
          SERVICE.
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-bold">1. The Playcer Service: A Peer-to-Peer Marketplace</h2>
        <h3 className="font-bold">1.1. Nature of the Service</h3>
        <p>
          Playcer is a technology platform that functions as a peer-to-peer
          (P2P) betting exchange. We are not a traditional bookmaker or
          sportsbook. Our Service provides a marketplace where users can bet
          directly against one another (&quot;back&quot; or &quot;lay&quot; an
          outcome) on various sporting events. Playcer facilitates these wagers
          by matching users with opposing positions; we are never a party to
          any wager. [1, 2, 3]
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold">1.2. No House Edge</h3>
        <p>
          We do not set odds. The odds available on the Service are determined
          by the users themselves. Because you are betting against other users,
          not against &quot;the house,&quot; our model does not include a
          traditional &quot;vig&quot; or &quot;juice.&quot; [1, 4]
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold">1.3. Wager Matching</h3>
        <p>
          A wager is only considered active and confirmed once it has been
          fully matched by one or more other users on the platform. We do not
          guarantee that any wager you propose will be matched. Unmatched
          wagers will be canceled at the start of the relevant event. [3]
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-bold">2. Eligibility and Geographic Restrictions</h2>
        <h3 className="font-bold">2.1. Age Requirement</h3>
        <p>
          You must be at least twenty-one (21) years of age to create an
          account and use the Service. It is a criminal offense to gamble while
          underage. [5]
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold">2.2. Location Requirement</h3>
        <p>
          The Service is available only to individuals physically located in a
          U.S. state or territory where participation in peer-to-peer
          skill-based contests and sports wagering is lawfully permitted. You
          agree that you will not access the Service from any jurisdiction
          where it is illegal to do so. We employ geo-fencing and other
          location-verification technologies to ensure compliance. Any attempt
          to circumvent these restrictions is a material breach of these Terms.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold">2.3. Legal Compliance</h3>
        <p>
          You are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the Service
          is compliant with all laws, rules, and regulations applicable to you.
          Federal law, including the Wire Act of 1961 and the Unlawful Internet
          Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (UIGEA), as well as state laws,
          govern sports wagering. [6, 7, 8] Accessing the Service is void where
          prohibited by law.
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-bold">3. Account Registration and Management</h2>
        <h3 className="font-bold">3.1. Account Creation</h3>
        <p>
          To use the Service, you must register for a personal account
          (&quot;Account&quot;). You agree to provide accurate, current, and
          complete information during the registration process and to update
          such information to keep it accurate. [9, 10]
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold">3.2. Single Account</h3>
        <p>
          You may establish and maintain only one Account. Should we discover
          that you have opened multiple accounts, we reserve the right to
          suspend or terminate any or all of your accounts and void any pending
          or winning wagers. [9, 10]
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold">3.3. Account Security</h3>
        <p>
          You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
          password and Account credentials. You are fully responsible for all
          activities that occur under your Account. You agree to notify us
          immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account. [10]
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold">3.4. Identity Verification</h3>
        <p>
          You authorize us, directly or through third parties, to make any
          inquiries we consider necessary to validate your identity and/or
          verify your registration information. This may include asking you for
          further information, requiring you to provide a government-issued ID,
          and confirming your information against third-party databases.
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-bold">4. Wagers, Fees, and Payments</h2>
        <h3 className="font-bold">4.1. Service Fee</h3>
        <p>
          Playcer charges a small commission on net winnings for a given
          market. This fee is our compensation for providing the platform that
          facilitates your wager. The exact commission rate will be clearly
          displayed before you confirm a wager. We do not charge a fee on
          losing wagers. [4]
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold">4.2. Deposits and Withdrawals</h3>
        <p>
          You may deposit funds into your Account via the approved methods
          listed on the Service. All deposits must be from a payment source on
          which you are the named account holder. All withdrawals will be paid
          to you via the same method of deposit, where possible.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold">4.3. Event Settlement</h3>
        <p>
          Wagers are settled based on the official results and statistics
          provided by our third-party data provider, &quot;The Odds API.&quot;
          [11] We are not responsible for errors or inaccuracies in the data
          provided by this third party. Once an event is settled, winnings
          (less our commission) will be credited to the winning users&apos;
          Accounts.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold">4.4. Errors</h3>
        <p>
          While we strive for accuracy, errors may occur. If a wager is
          accepted at clearly incorrect odds due to a technical or human error,
          or if an event is settled incorrectly, we reserve the right to void
          the wager or resettle it at the correct terms. [12]
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-bold">5. User Conduct and Prohibited Activities</h2>
        <p>You agree not to engage in any of the following prohibited activities:</p>

        </ul>

        <h2 className="font-bold">6. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          The Service and all of its content, features, and functionality
          (including but not limited to all software, text, graphics, logos,

          jurisdiction.

          YOU AND PLAYCER AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER
