        <h1>About Playcer</h1>
        <p className="lead">
          Playcer was born from a simple observation: the most exciting bets
          aren't against a faceless house, but against a friend, a rival, or
          that guy in the group chat who's always a little too confident about
          his team. We're here to make those personal challenges real,
          legitimate, and more thrilling than ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are not a traditional sportsbook. We are a marketplace for passion.
          We provide the technology to connect you directly with other fans,
          letting you set your own terms and create wagers on the games you
          care about most. There's no "house edge" here because we're not the
          house. Your opponent is another fan, just as invested as you are.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is to bring the social and competitive spirit back to
          sports betting. We believe that betting should be personal. It should
          be about the friendly rivalries, the bragging rights, and the shared
          experience of the game. By removing the house from the equation, we
          empower fans to engage with sports and each other in a more authentic
          way.
        </p>
